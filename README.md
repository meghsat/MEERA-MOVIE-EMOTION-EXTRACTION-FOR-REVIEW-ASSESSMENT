Abstract: In recent times, emotion Analysis has become an effective way to extract peoples' review about products. 
We use this Emotion Extraction classification technique to generate reviews from movies. The future of the movie cast, and crew primarily depends on the reviews, but often these reviews are biased and are tampered. 
To handle these problems, we propose a less unbiased model called-MEERA (Movie Emotion Extraction for Review Assessment). The model extracts the facial emotions from spectators in movie theatres under poor lighting 
conditions and quantifies these expressions into reviews. MEERA handles various challenges like low light conditions, crowd segregation, appropriate time intervals to capture crowd emotions, and emotions to review 
quantification.
